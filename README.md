# Operating Systems Concepts - Projects & Exercises

This repository contains a collection of projects, exercises, and code implementations completed for the Operating Systems course, based on the textbook **Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition** by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The work here demonstrates practical applications and explorations of core OS concepts, including process management, scheduling, synchronization, memory management, and file systems.
